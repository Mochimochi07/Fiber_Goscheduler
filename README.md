# Fiber_Goscheduler
This is my repository about go scheduler using fiber.

Hi, this is my golang scheduler repository.

Feel free to use this as an example for scheduling.

To use this you may need an api tool for it to work.

use the post method and wait for 1 minute and the text will show in the command line where you open the main.go file.

The scheduler is more of an advance goroutine that can be executed in time.

i meant an employee making a specific task within a time like washing the dishes and after a minute he goes cleaning the table.

Its just simple scheduling you may figure it out shortly.
